== Email Delay Send ==

Using Google Apps scripts this project allows a gmail user to schedule an email
to be delivered at a later point.

This project was previously know as Gmail Delay Send and hosted at:
https://code.google.com/p/gmail-delay-send.

With the turn down of Google Code and the illegal use of the name "Gmail" it has
been changed to "Email Delay Send".

Currently this project is not complete as the datejs library has been removed.
This file will be updated when the project is ready for public consumption.

NOTE: This is not an official Google product!
